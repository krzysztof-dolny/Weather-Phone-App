# Weather-Phone-App

I created a weather application written in Kotlin using Android Studio. The application supports Polish, English, and German languages. It uses an HTTPS request with the Volley library to fetch the latest weather data for the current day. The Picasso library is used for loading images. By default, the application displays the weather for the user's current location if the permission for using location is granted. There are basic animations during fragment switching and in the RecyclerView, allowing users to see the weather forecast for every hour.
